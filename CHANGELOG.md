The well-ordered and perhaps the most reusable way to organize your code is to use the 'MVVM' pattern. The Model, View, ViewModel (MVVM pattern) is all about  how to organize and structure your code to write maintainable, testable and extensible applications.

Model − It simply holds the data and has nothing to do with any of the business logic.

ViewModel − It acts as the link/connection between the Model and View and makes stuff look pretty.

View − It simply holds the formatted data and essentially delegates everything to the Model.
